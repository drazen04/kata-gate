    /**
     * As youâ€™re a very friendly person, you would like to send a birthday note to all the friends you have.
     * But you have a lot of friends and a bit lazy, it may take some times to write all the notes by hand.
     * The good news is that computers can do it automatically for you.
     * Imagine you have a flat file with all your friends :
     *  last_name, first_name, date_of_birth, email
     *  Doe, John, 1982/10/08, john.doe@foobar.com
     *  Ann, Mary, 1975/09/11, mary.ann@foobar.com
     * And you want to send them a happy birthday email on their birth date :
     *  Subject: Happy birthday!
     *  Happy birthday, dear <first_name>!
     *
     * How would this software look like ? Try to implement it so you can easily change :
     * - the way you retrieve the friends data (for instance, try switching to a SQLite Db)
     * - the way you send the note : (for instance, imagine you want to send SMS instead of emails)
     *
     * What kind of tests would you write ? Would you use Mocks ?
