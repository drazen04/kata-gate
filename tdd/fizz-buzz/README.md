# Fizz Buzz Kata

This kata is based on the classic Fizz Buzz problem. The goal is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to n, but for multiples of three it should output "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five it should output "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five it should output "FizzBuzz".
